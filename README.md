Have you ever wanted to be able to guess what letter a *computer* might be thinking of?
**Well here's your chance!**

Give my Psychic Game a try - [link to game!](https://peteawalk.github.io/psychic_game/)
Guaranteed to be cheaper than calling the Psychic Hotline.

## How to play
* Type the letter than you want to guess. You have 10 tries to get it right.
* If your guess is wrong, it will be tracked.
* If you guess the correct letter, you will see the correct letter displayed to you.
* If you reach 10 guess, you lose!

Feel free to share any comments you have on my game. Thanks for playing!
